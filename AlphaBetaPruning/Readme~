Both of these files run as games if you type:
python HW2.py TicTacToe.txt
python HW2-ExtraCredit.py ExtraCredit.txt

Alternatively, you can watch 2 AI players play, what I believe should be an optimal game, by running:
python HW2-ExtraCredit.py ExtraCredit.txt auto

HW2.py has the output formatted assuming regular TicTacToe.  It will look awkward otherwise.

The two files implement the board state differently, since I didn't think of the second method until later on. They are described in the respective files.


The result for the extracredit looks strange, since neither player takes the free point at 1 until the last turn.  I haven't combed through the game to check whether this is actually the resolution to this game, but it's certainly surprising.
