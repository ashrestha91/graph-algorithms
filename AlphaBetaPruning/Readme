Both of these files run as games if you type:
python TicTacToe.py TicTacToe.txt
python WeightedTTT.py WeightedTTT.txt

Alternatively, you can watch 2 AI players play by running (feature needs to be added for TicTacToe.py):
python WeightedTTT.py WeightedTTT.txt auto

TicTacToe.py has the output formatted assuming regular TicTacToe.

TicTacToe.py will be soon updated to use the same board format as WeightedTTT.py.

As this algorithm grows exponentially, I will be attempting to improve the performance of this algorithm to work on larger size games.  The main methods I am considering are writing C extensions, and memoizing boards to eliminate the need to compute transposed games.
